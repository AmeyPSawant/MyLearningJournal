# Beginner: Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path
## Introduction to Generative AI
<ul>
<li>Generative AI Definition and Functionality: Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that creates new content—such as text, images, audio, and video—by learning patterns from existing data. It uses models like neural networks and transformers to generate outputs based on input prompts, distinguishing it from discriminative models that classify or predict data.

<li>Types of Generative AI Models: Generative AI encompasses various model types, including text-to-text, text-to-image, text-to-video, and text-to-task models. These models can perform tasks like language translation, image generation, video creation, and executing specific actions based on textual input.

<li>Applications and Tools: Generative AI has broad applications across industries, from healthcare to customer service. Tools like Google’s Vertex AI Studio and Gemini enable developers to build, fine-tune, and deploy generative AI models, even with minimal coding experience, facilitating tasks like code generation, sentiment analysis, and personalized customer interactions.
</ul>

## Introduction to Large Language Models
<ul>
<li> Large Language Models (LLMs) Overview: LLMs are a subset of deep learning and generative AI, designed to process and generate human-like text. They are pre-trained on massive datasets and fine-tuned for specific tasks, enabling them to perform a wide range of language-related functions such as translation, summarization, and question answering with minimal domain-specific training.

<li> Key Features and Use Cases: LLMs are characterized by their large-scale training data and parameter counts, allowing them to handle diverse tasks like text generation, classification, and even complex reasoning (e.g., chain-of-thought reasoning). They excel in few-shot or zero-shot learning scenarios, requiring little to no additional training data for specific applications.

<li> Development and Tuning Tools: Google Cloud offers tools like Vertex AI Studio and Gemini for building, fine-tuning, and deploying LLMs. These tools enable developers to customize models for specific use cases, such as sentiment analysis or customer support, with minimal coding expertise. Parameter-efficient tuning methods (PETM) further optimize LLMs without altering the base model.
</ul>

## Introduction to Responsible AI
<ul>
<li> Responsible AI Practices: Responsible AI involves ensuring transparency, fairness, accountability, and privacy in AI systems. Organizations, including Google, develop their own AI principles to guide ethical decision-making throughout the AI lifecycle, from design to deployment, to avoid bias, harm, or unintended consequences.
<li> Human-Centric AI Development: AI systems are shaped by human decisions and values at every stage, from data collection to deployment. Responsible AI requires continuous evaluation to ensure ethical considerations are prioritized, building trust and ensuring AI benefits society while minimizing risks.
<li> Google’s AI Principles: Google’s seven AI principles focus on social benefit, avoiding bias, safety, accountability, privacy, scientific excellence, and responsible use. These principles guide product development and business decisions, ensuring AI aligns with ethical standards and avoids harmful applications like surveillance or weapons.
</ul>

## Prompt Design in Vertex AI
<ul>
<li>
Generative AI with Vertex AI: Prompt Design
In this lab, I learned prompt engineering best practices using Google’s Generative AI SDK. Key steps included setting up a Vertex AI Workbench notebook, applying concise and specific prompts, reducing output variability with system instructions, and improving response quality by including examples. I also explored text generation use cases like ideation, question answering, and classification, while following guidelines to minimize hallucinations and ensure task-specific outputs. This hands-on experience highlighted effective strategies for leveraging large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications.

<li> Get Started with Vertex AI Studio
In this lab, I learned to analyze images and videos using Gemini in Vertex AI Studio's Freeform mode, extracting and generating information through well-designed prompts. I explored text prompt design techniques like zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting, adjusting parameters like temperature and token limits to influence model responses. Additionally, I created conversational prompts in Chat mode, experimenting with system instructions to guide the model's behavior. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of multimodal AI capabilities and effective prompt engineering strategies.
