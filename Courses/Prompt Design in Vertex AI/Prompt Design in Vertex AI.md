# Prompt Design in Vertex AI
## Lab 1 - Generative AI with Vertex AI: Prompt Design
In this lab, I learned prompt engineering best practices using Google’s Generative AI SDK. Key steps included setting up a Vertex AI Workbench notebook, applying concise and specific prompts, reducing output variability with system instructions, and improving response quality by including examples. I also explored text generation use cases like ideation, question answering, and classification, while following guidelines to minimize hallucinations and ensure task-specific outputs. This hands-on experience highlighted effective strategies for leveraging large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications.

## Lab 2 - Get Started with Vertex AI Studio
In this lab, I learned to analyze images and videos using Gemini in Vertex AI Studio's Freeform mode, extracting and generating information through well-designed prompts. I explored text prompt design techniques like zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting, adjusting parameters like temperature and token limits to influence model responses. Additionally, I created conversational prompts in Chat mode, experimenting with system instructions to guide the model's behavior. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of multimodal AI capabilities and effective prompt engineering strategies.

## Lab 3 - Getting Started with the Gemini API in Vertex AI
In this lab, I learned to use the Gemini API in Vertex AI with the Vertex AI SDK for Python, focusing on the Gemini 1.5 Pro model. I generated text from text prompts, images, and videos, explored streaming responses, and adjusted safety filters to control content output. Additionally, I experimented with multimodal prompts, combining text and images, and analyzed publicly available web media. This hands-on experience equipped me with practical skills to integrate and leverage Gemini’s generative AI capabilities for diverse applications.

## Lab 4 - Prompt Design in Vertex AI: Challenge Lab
In this challenge lab, I applied my skills in Vertex AI to create tools for Cymbal Direct’s marketing campaign. I built a Gemini image analysis tool to generate evocative product descriptions and a tagline generator using Freeform prompts, customizing outputs based on product attributes and emotional resonance. I also explored and modified Python code for both tools in Jupyter Notebooks, refining prompts to produce creative and specific results. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of prompt design and generative AI implementation in real-world scenarios.
