# Flow Builder Basics

## Get Started with Business Process Automation

If input from a user is required use -

- **Screen Flows:** Use Flow Builder to create an interaction _that presents info and asks your users questions_.
- **Autolaunched Flows:** Use Flow Builder to create automation _that runs when a button is clicked_. These can also be run by other automations.
- **Approval Processes:** Build a series of steps with assigned approvers. Those steps can automate tasks such as locking and updating records. An approval process can run manually, _when a button is clicked_, or automatically, when it's launched by another automation.
- **Lightning Components:** Use HTML and JavaScript code to _build an interactive component_ that you can embed in a page or an app.
- **Visualforce Pages:** Use HTML and Apex code _to build an interactive page_.

If business process should start automatically and run behind the scenes -

- **Record-Triggered Flows:** Use Flow Builder to create automation that runs _when a record is created, edited, or deleted_.
- **Schedule-Triggered Flows:** Use Flow Builder to create automation that _runs at a time and frequency you specify_.
- **Platform Event-Triggered Flows:** Use Flow Builder to create automation that runs _when a platform event message is received_.
- **Data Cloud-Triggered Flow:** Use Flow Builder to create automation that runs* when a change is made to data in Data 360*.
- **Apex:** Use Apex code to write _reusable blocks of automation_. You can trigger this code in a variety of ways.

## Go with the Flow

Refer [Glossary](./Glossary.md) for the meanings of [Salesforce Flow](./Glossary.md#salesforce-flow), [Flow](./Glossary.md#flow), [Flow Builder](./Glossary.md#flow-builder), [Flonatic](./Glossary.md#flownatic).

### Flows Are Friends

Flows look like flowcharts: They’re made up of boxes and connecting arrows that show the ordered details of a business process. There’s one big difference, however. While flowcharts show a process, flows can actually do the steps in the process.

### Know When to Flow ’Em

Flows are ideal for automating processes that involve conditional logic and actions.  
They are easier to create and maintain compared to custom code, making them a cost-effective solution for many use cases.  
However, some scenarios may still require custom code, such as generating PDFs or handling complex requirements.
