# Introduction to the cloud
AWS Started in 2003.  
In 2004, __SQS(Simple Queue Service)__ was invented.  
In 2006, __S3(Simple Storage Service)__ and __EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)__ was invented.  
It is an on-demand service provider, pay as you go.  

## Various Cloud Deployment Types
* Cloud-based  
Migrated everything to the cloud and utilize virtual servers and databases.
* On-Premises  
Uses application management & virtualization of technologies increasing resource utilization.
* Hybrid  
Cloud-based resources and on-premises infrastructure work together.

## Six benefits of cloud computing
1) Trade fixed expense for variable expense.  
No need to buy all the infrastructure and setup data  centers which cost a lot.
2) Benefit from massive economies of scale.  
AWS buys infrastructure in bulk at a lower rate thus giving the customers the services at a much lower prices.
3) Stop guessing capacity.  
Customers can dynamically scale AWS Cloud Resources up or down based on real-time demand.
4) Increase speed and agility.  
Can try different things by spinning up test environments and thus innovating new things.
5) Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.  
Spend less time in running and maintaining the servers and focus on customers.
6) Go global in minutes.  
Can deploy to any provided region in the world and thus expanding business worldwide.

## AWS Global Infrastuctue 
Helps in providing __high availability__ and __fault tolerance__.  
AWS has _Regions_(Physical Locations) like Paris, Ohio, etc.  
And each Region has _AZ_'s (Availability Zones), a minimum of 3 zones in a region.

## AWS Shared Responsibility
AWS - Security of the cloud (Physical, Network, Hypervisor)  
Customer - Security in the cloud (Operating System, Keeping OS Patched)  
For e.g.  
Builder creating a building with rooms and doors with locks.  
Residents (Customers) are responsible for locking of the door.
