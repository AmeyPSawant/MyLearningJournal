# Pricing and Support

## Driving factors of Pricing
* Compute  
Compute cost includes services like EC2, Lambda, and ECS, when you're charged based on the processing power and time used.  
* Storage  
Storage includes services like S3 and EBS, and pricing is based on the amount of data stored and for how long.  
* Data Transfer  
Data that is being transferred out of AWS and would incur charges.

## Billing
* Single Account  
With a single account, itâ€™s all encompassed in that one account.

* Consolidated Account  
Multiple AWS accounts (subaccounts) link to a primary account, combining all charges into a single bill for simplified payment and centralized cost visibility.
