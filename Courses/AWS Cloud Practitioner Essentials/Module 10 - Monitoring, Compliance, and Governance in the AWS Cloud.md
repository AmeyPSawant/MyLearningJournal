# Monitoring, Compliance, and Governance in the AWS Cloud

## Amazon CloudWatch
CloudWatch collects metrics from all your AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS and on-premises servers.  
With CloudWatch alarms, you can define thresholds on CloudWatch metrics and send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources.  
Dashboards are customizable home pages in the CloudWatch console that you can use to monitor your resources in a single view.  
CloudWatch Logs centralize the logs from all of the systems, applications, and AWS services that you use.  

## Amazon CloudTrail
CloudTrail is an audit log of the AWS API calls, so it is a history of configurations and changes in a deployment.  
CloudTrail even comes with features to validate log file integrity to show evidence of tampering.  
- CloudTrail events capture details about actions performed within your AWS account, such as API calls, console actions, or other activities.  
- CloudTrail monitors events and delivers those events as log files to your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.  
- CloudTrail Insights analyzes your normal patterns of API call volume and API error rates and also generates Insights events when API call volumes and error rates deviate from these normal patterns.  

## AWS Config
AWS Config is a service that you can use to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.  

## AWS Organizations
Organizations helps you centrally manage and govern your environment as you grow and scale your AWS resources.
