# Migrating to the AWS Cloud

## Three phases of Migration process
* Pre-migration Assessment tools - Migration Evaluator to evaluate the migration process
* Migration tools - AWS Application Discovery Service and AWS Migration Hub
* Migration tools - AWS Application Migration Service and AWS Database Migration Service
* Data Transfer tools - AWS DataSync, AWS Transfer Family, AWS Snow Family

## AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (_CAF_)
The AWS CAF is a framework that brings AWS experience and best practices to companies preparing to migrate to the AWS Cloud.  
Six areas CAF is divided into are
* __Business__  
The Business perspective makes sure that IT aligns with business needs and that IT investments link to key business results.  
* __People__  
The People perspective supports development of an organization-wide change management strategy for successful cloud adoption.  
* __Governance__  
The Governance perspective focuses on skills and processes to align IT strategy with business strategy. This perspective helps you maximize business value and minimize risks.  
* __Platform__  
The Platform perspective includes principles and patterns for implementing new solutions in the cloud and migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.  
* __Security__  
The Security perspective makes sure that the organization meets security objectives for visibility, auditability, control, and agility.  
* __Operations__  
The Operations perspective helps you to enable, run, use, operate, and recover IT workloads to the level agreed upon with your business stakeholders.  

## 7R's of Cloud Migration
* __Rehost__  
Also called as lift and shift.
* __Relocate__  
Relocating is changing the hosting location to the cloud. 
* __Replatform__  
Lift, tinker and shift.
* __Refactor__  
Refactoring, also known as re-architecting, involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using features built for the cloud.
* __Repurchase__  
Repurchasing involves moving from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model.
* __Retain__  
Retaining consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment. 
* __Retire__  
Retiring is the process of removing applications that are no longer needed.
