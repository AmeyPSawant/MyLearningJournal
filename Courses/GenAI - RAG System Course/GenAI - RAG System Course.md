To help computers understand text -  

**Text Preprocessing**  
Text processing consits of multiple ways such as lowercasing, removing stopwords, stemming and lemmatization.

**Tokenization**  
Breaking down the sentence to tokens (words) so that the computer can analyze them further.  
Basically it turns text to data for analysis.  
Two types - Word Tokenization and Sentence Tokenization.

**Embedddings**  
Turns words into vectors (numerical data for analysis).  
Similar ot what a encoder does (One Hot Encoding).
