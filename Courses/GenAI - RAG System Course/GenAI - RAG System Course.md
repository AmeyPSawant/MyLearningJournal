**Text Preprocessing**  
Text processing consits of multiple ways such as lowercasing, removing stopwords, stemming and lemmatization.

**Tokenization**  
Breaking down the sentence to tokens (words) so that the computer can analyze them further.  
Basically it turns text to data for analysis.  
Two types - Word Tokenization and Sentence Tokenization.

**Embedddings**  
Turns words into vectors (numerical data for analysis).  
Similar ot what a encoder does (One Hot Encoding).

 ## Attention Mechanism  
 **Why?**  
 Whwn models process the vectors they struggle t odecide what is most important context of the sentence.  

 **What?**  
 It's a process that helps computers decide what is the important context in the sentence.  

 **How?**  
 It assigns importance to words in the sentence.  
 It then calculates importance scores.

 Normal text processing the computers forgot the relation between the words as they kept on processing new words. So instead of processing 

 **What?**
It helps in understanding and relating an entire sentence rather than words even if the words are far apart.

**How?**
