# Model Context Protocol (MCP)
## LLMs v/s LLMs + Tools v/s LLMs + MCP?
**LLMs**
LLMs by themselves are incapable of doing anything meaningful
For e.g. - If you ask LLMto send you an email then it's not capable of doing it.

**LLM + Tools**
We can add tools to LLMs but it's a lot of manual work.
For e.g. - If using Slack Services it updates the service then updating the system becomes tough.

**LLM + MCP**
MCP acts as a layer between LLM and Services to help LLM communicate efficiently.

## MCP
**MCP CLient**
Uses MCP Protocol to commnicate withe the MCP Server
For e.g. - Tempo, Windsurf

**MCP Server & Service**
Maintained by Service Provider
For e.g. - Slack, Google
